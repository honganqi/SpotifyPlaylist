# Genshin White

I just want to share the playlists I've been making of the Genshin soundtrack. For this post, it's for the color WHITE: white for peace, serenity, tranquility, stillness. The music in this playlist may make you smile but it is not the main purpose of this playlist. You can use this for sleeping, meditating, and situations when you just need to clear your mind.

# Spotify

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6150kZ2Bi4CeY6KHKRK0W7?si=da8b3d35e0a74b7e](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6150kZ2Bi4CeY6KHKRK0W7?si=da8b3d35e0a74b7e)

As we all know, this game is full of a wide variety of emotions: from the normal life in Mondstadt, the richness of life in Liyue, the despair and battles in Inazuma, the hopelessness and darkness in the Chasm, the contrast of the abundance and desolation in Sumeru, the grandeur of Fontaine, the festive cultures of Chenyu Vale, the inviting nature of Natlan, and who knows what awaits us in Snezhnaya!

I started making these playlists before the Fontaine patch so I expected a lot of tracks were going to be included in this color, particularly those from Liyue, Watatsumi, and the green lands of Sumeru. I'm glad a lot of the Fontaine tracks got in but I didn't expect this maybe because I expected grandeur music and maybe because I'm haven't started the Fontaine Archon Quests. Chenyu Vale was a no-brainer given the scenery! The title screen really says something about the direction the devs wanted for this game. I've been using this playlist to help me sleep and while driving (among others). I would even want to go ahead and say that these tracks are great for meditation but that's totally up to you. Mental health is a very important consideration these days and I hope this playlist can help.

If you think there's a track that doesn't belong in this playlist (or one that should be here but isn't), feel free to comment. For the rationale of colors and music, please see the \[Colors\] section below.

# Visualization

A sprinkle of sunlight hits my eyes as I force myself back to sleep but a gentle wind touches my face and props me up instead. What happened yesterday? I don't remember. And it's ok. Today is beautiful. I take a deep breath. Is that tea I smell? Oh, it's just my mind telling me to start my day! And it's ok. I hear something. A water feature? Leaves rustling? It doesn't matter. And it's ok. Thank you for today.

# Colors

I started using color schemes for my playlists in 2005: yellow for happiness, orange for joy, blue for sorrow, red for passion, white for peace, gray/black for despair. And since we all know that Genshin has this godly collection of music, that's what I've been trying to do for the past year. Keyword: trying (priorities and all that, sorry).
