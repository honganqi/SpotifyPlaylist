# Genshin Gray

I just want to share the playlists I've been making of the Genshin soundtrack. For this post, it's for the color GRAY (or grey): gray for brooding, hopelessness, despair, desolation, doom. A word of warning: If you think you're not at your healthiest state mentally, you may want to skip this playlist. If you do try out and like this playlist, I advise not listening to it for more than 1 or 2 hours per day. This specific playlist isn't recommended for daily listening. I will be releasing "lighter-colored playlists" soon which will better fit that purpose.

# Spotify

I know that as a first post (for the music/color series), it's not good to start with this playlist but this was the first thing I was able to complete. I will also have to admit that I have liked this kind of music probably since 2001. For your reference, some examples of this kind of music outside of Genshin:

* "Solaris" by Juno Reactor
* "Air Shriek" by Ken Ishii
* "Angel" by Massive Attack (and a LOT from this artist)
* "Acre Underworld" by Jesper Kyd (from Assassin's Creed)
* "Vertigen" by Recoil (also found in Need For Speed Undercover)

As we all know, this game is full of a wide variety of emotions: from the normal life in Mondstadt, the richness of life in Liyue, the despair and battles in Inazuma, the hopelessness and darkness in the Chasm, the contrast of the abundance and desolation in Sumeru, the grandeur of Fontaine, the festive cultures of Chenyu Vale, and now the ... I don't know... I'm at a loss of words to describe Natlan!

I kinda expected Mondstadt and Liyue not to have any of these gray tracks, and I fully expected Inazuma, Chasm, and the desert portion of Sumeru to be full of these. What I did not expect was for Natlan to have any at all! Or at least not as of writing on October 6, 2024. Natlan’s vibe is so peaceful. For context, I still haven’t even finished the Sumeru Archon Quests. Life and all…

If you think there's a track that doesn't belong in this playlist (or one that should be here but isn't), feel free to comment. For the rationale of colors and music, please see the \[Colors\] section below.

# Visualization

There is a dry and arid smell to the air. There is fire, but I cannot see it. It is dark everywhere. How did I get here? Was I asleep? What happened here? I feel tense, yet I cannot sense danger. It feels like the place is drenched with despair, hopelessness. I have to get out of here. My feet are heavy. Are these Oozing Concretions? From Dark Mud? Am I in the Chasm? But there is wind, and dust, and I see... Are those pyramids? Am I in King Deshret's domain? *flashes of light suddenly blind you, bringing you visions of Liyue* Finally! Liyue, joy of joys! There has to be somebod... Oh, no. What happened here? Where is all this fire coming from? Where is everybody? Millileth? Anybody, please...

# Colors

I started using color schemes for my playlists in 2005: yellow for happiness, orange for joy, blue for sorrow, red for passion, white for peace, gray/black for despair. And since we all know that Genshin has this godly collection of music, that's what I've been trying to do for the past year. Keyword: trying (priorities and all that, sorry).
